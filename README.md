# MostFoodiefulPath
Project for algorithms class summer 2015. Uses Google Maps and Yelp APIs to find the "Most Foodie-ful Path."
The old Yelp API has since been deprecated, so this code would need to be updated in order to actually work again

Tasks:
1. Refactor to use the new and improved Yelp API
2. Spruce up the UI with some CSS
